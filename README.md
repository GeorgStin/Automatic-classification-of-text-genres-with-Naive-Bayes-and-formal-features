# Automatic-classification-of-text-genres-with-Naive-Bayes-and-formal-features

This repository implements a lightweight, language-agnostic genre classifier that distinguishes scientific prose from fiction using only shallow, surface-level text features.

## Overview

- **Task:** Binary document classification (science vs. fiction). 
- **Languages:** German and Russian, with parallel, genre-balanced corpora.
- **Model:** Gaussian Naive Bayes over 7 simple statistical features.
- **Goal:** Demonstrate that genres can be separated using inexpensive, language-robust features and a simple probabilistic model.
